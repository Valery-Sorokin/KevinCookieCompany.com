		<p>
			ingredients. Butter from grass fed cows. Unbleached flour with the best flavor and textures. Organic sugar
			only from India. Eggs from chickens that listen to classical music. Even our water is special. It comes from
			the Cascade Mountain springs that we hike up to retrieve. Baking is our passion and we take it very
			seriously.
